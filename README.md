I adapted a professional HTML/CSS/Bootstrap template to build a responsive front-end portfolio 
Project: Responsive Portfolio (HTML · CSS · Bootstrap)

I took an available Bootstrap-based template and reworked it into a fully responsive portfolio that demonstrates my front-end skills and attention to detail. Key improvements included:

Rewriting the structure with semantic HTML and organizing content blocks for accessibility and maintainability.

Combining CSS Grid and Bootstrap’s grid system to create flexible, modular layouts that adapt cleanly from large screens down to small mobile devices.

Customizing Bootstrap utilities and creating a small component stylesheet to show visual consistency while keeping the code DRY.

Implementing subtle hover interactions and micro-animations using CSS transitions to enhance UX without hurting performance.

Ensuring mobile-first responsiveness: custom breakpoints, optimized images, and touch-friendly controls make the site feel smooth on phones and tablets.

Testing across viewport sizes and refining spacing, typography, and alignment so the design remains balanced at every screen width.

This project was intentionally scoped to highlight practical, production-ready front-end techniques: grid-based layouts, responsive design, Bootstrap proficiency, and clean CSS for maintainable UI components.
