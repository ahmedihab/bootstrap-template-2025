Bootstrap Template Refactor: Responsive Portfolio
Project Overview: A professional-grade portfolio refactor focusing on modern front-end standards, semantic architecture, and responsive precision.

🚀 Technical Highlights
Semantic Architecture: Rewrote the core structure using HTML5 semantic tags to ensure high accessibility (A11y), better SEO, and a maintainable DOM structure.

Hybrid Layout System: Combined CSS Grid with the Bootstrap 12-column system to create a modular layout that handles complex alignment better than standard Bootstrap alone.

Custom Modular CSS: Developed a dedicated stylesheet for custom components, adhering to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and overriding Bootstrap defaults only where necessary for visual branding.

Performance-First UI: Implemented lightweight CSS transitions for hover states and micro-animations, ensuring a high-end feel without the performance overhead of heavy JavaScript libraries.

Mobile-First Refinement: Optimized the experience for touch devices with custom breakpoints, fluid typography, and touch-friendly interactive elements.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: HTML5, CSS3

Framework: Bootstrap 5

Methodology: Mobile-First Design, Responsive Web Design (RWD)

📅 Project Roadmap (Coming Soon)
I am currently expanding this project from a static portfolio into a dynamic utility. Planned features include:

Interactive Watchlist: A dedicated module for tracking projects or stocks using local storage/API integration.

Dark Mode Toggle: Implementing CSS variables for a seamless light/dark theme switcher.

Contact Form Validation: Adding client-side validation using JavaScript.

Why I Built This
This project was intentionally scoped to demonstrate production-ready front-end skills. By taking an existing template and refactoring it, I’ve showcased my ability to clean up legacy code, optimize layouts for various viewports, and implement professional UI/UX standards.
